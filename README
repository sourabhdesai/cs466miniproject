Spreadsheet file is under name "evaluation.xlsx"
Evaluation.pdf is under name "Miniproject Evaluation.pdf"

Let me know if there is anything I should change/add to either of these. I was thinking of adding some graphs related to the Relative Entropy calculations. I created some but none of them showed any interesting trends so I didn't include them. I may make some changes before the due date. Ill let you know if I do.
